## Description

- Drawing gradient on top of multiple UI sections.
- View-pager banner like with snapping behavior
- Grid section with two view item type
- Bottom navigation and handling back button

## Disclaimer
At the time of writing, I'm not employed by Astro. Everything from code, layout, to design took inspiration from Astro app from end-user perspective. I use `uiautomatorviewer` to measure some dimension and color picker to pick the right color for certain UI.

I use [Genshin Impact game assets](https://github.com/genshindev/api) for this project. HoYoverse/miHoYo [allow third-party developer](https://www.hoyolab.com/article/143107) to use its game assets for personal project.
